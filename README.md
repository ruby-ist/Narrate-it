# Narrate-it!

Narrate-it is a blogging website I created as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails)'s `Ruby on Rails` course. In Narrate-it, everyone can post a blog about their daily life and routine stuffs. You must have an account to create a blog. You are humbly requested to follow the guidelines and regulation and not to post anything offensive. <br/> <br/> The posts created in narrate-it uses <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">markdown formatting</a> style. Any styles applied in markdown (`*.md` file) can also applied while creating a post in the blog. Your profile picture will be your image associated with your <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">gravatar</a> by default as of now. The custom profile picture feature may be updated in future.
